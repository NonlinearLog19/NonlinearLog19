Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile! Iâ€™m passionate about all things in design, mostly in interior and exterior house designs. 
Whether itâ€™s creating cozy living spaces or envisioning stunning outdoor landscapes, I hope one day I can turn some of my ideas into reality.

What Iâ€™m Up To ðŸŒ±
Currently, Iâ€™m learning about the world of multimedia and web design.  
From responsive layouts to captivating animations, Iâ€™m exploring it all.

Fun Fact âš¡
Did you know? I wear multiple hats! Iâ€™m a cameraman, and media manager for a large church.

(2024) This year's website goals ðŸ’ª
1 - Make an official website for my Dad's construction buisness.
2 - Update the our church's website throughout the summer. (It doesn't look good and has many code mistakes)
